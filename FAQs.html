    	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
    <p><span class= "gold">How do I set it so that only admins/mods can start battles?</span>
    <br>You can do that by allowing only a certain role to send messages in that channel.

    <p><span class="gold">Where is the weapon I won from my match?</span>
    <br>Era weapons can only be used if you already own the era it is from. It is also just like another weapon in the game, there is no equipping it (it’s not a skin). You can use it in battle randomly like any other weapon. 

    <p><span  class= "gold">How do I add the bot to my server?</span>
    <br>Use <span class="code">?invite</span> or you can also click <a class="silver" href="https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=693167035068317736&permissions=523344&scope=bot" target="_blank">here!</a>.

    <p><span  class= "gold">How do I add staff through the bot?</span>
    <br>The command to add staff through the bot is <span class="code">?staff add UserID/RoleID</span>.<br><a class="silver" href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID" target="_blank">Here's how you get someone's ID</a>.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I make custom eras/phrases?</span>
    <br>At this time there are no plans to implement that. It’s too big of an undertaking.

    <p><span  class= "gold">The bot is down!</span>
    <br>It’s more than likely just lagging. Give it a few minutes and it’ll be back to normal.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I buy skins and eras for real money?</span>
    <br>No, Rumble Royale does not have any form of monetization. 

    <p><span  class= "gold">How do I set up an automatic battle?</span>
    <br>First, make sure there’s a staff battle set up in that channel. Then run <span class="code">?automatic setup</span> and it will walk you through it.

    <p><span  class= "gold">I’ve opened so many backpacks and haven’t gotten an era yet!</span>
    <br>Keep trying. There’s a very small percentage of getting an era in backpacks. If it were easy to get them there wouldn’t be a point of continuing to play the game.

    <p><span  class= "gold">How do I unlock new eras?</span>
    <br>Any of the previous season eras can be obtained through backpacks. The current season’s era can be obtained by reaching 100,000XP in the Season Pass.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I give/send someone gems, gold or any cosmetics?</span>
    <br>No, Rumble Royale doesn't support gifting or trading any of its currencies or items.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Why is an automatic battle not starting although it met the player requirement / the given time between battles has already passed?</span>
    <br>The bot starts automatic battles one by one globally across all servers, if there is a delay in a particular automatic battle it may be because there is another major automatic battle ongoing somewhere else.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I get items from the rumble pass after the season is over?</span>
    <br>No, the only thing available in the backpacks after the season is over is the given era.

    <p><span  class= "gold">I voted for the bot so why does it say I didn't and I can't claim my gems?</span>
    <br>Sometimes it takes a while for you to be able to claim it, try using <span class="code">?claim</span> after a few minutes. If it still doesn't work, feel free to open a ticket and contact us.<br> Note: You can vote once every 12 hours and the delay between vote and claim doesn't affect the time you have to wait to vote again.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I set up automatic battles in my server without becoming partner?</span>
    <br>Yes, if you have 1,000 members or more automatic battles are available to you. 

    <p><span  class= "gold">Where can I find a full list of commands or info about the bot?</span>
    <br>Run the commands <span class="code">?help</span> and <span class="code">?info</span>.</p>
